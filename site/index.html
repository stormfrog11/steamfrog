	<title>Hello Robert!</title>
</head>
<body>
<h1>This is the site</h1>
<p>Add in some text for good measure and what not</p>
<p>and some more</p>
<p>and a little bit more</p>
<p>one more shot</p>
<p>another test - going through the entire cycle again</p>
<p>making another git edit, for practice</p>
<p>i wonder why these edits do not appear in the browser, that is truly a mystery</p>
<p>browser sync enabled?</p>
<p>yes it is, on the local file that is!!!</p>
<ol>
	<li>what a great</li>
	<li>day for some</li>
	<li>sunshine :)</li>
</ol>
<p>This is taking longer than I would like, but I'm learning a little bit at a time</p>
<p>My catastrophic thoughts:</p>
<ul>
<li>I'll never be good at this</li>
<li>It won't be needed by anybody</li>
<li>I'll screw everything up</li>
</ul>
<p>Getting get to work on my PC feels like a big accomplishment. Be happy you made it this far Robert.</p>
